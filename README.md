# NFTAuctioneer Soliidity smart contract

This auction smart contract let you auction your NFT. 

Additional functions implemented with what I learnt in the course are:

-- withdrawNFT : with this, the highestbidder can withdraw the nft after the auction has ended
-- endBeforeTime: the seller can cancel the auction by ending the auction before the endtime
